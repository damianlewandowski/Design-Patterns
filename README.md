# Factory Method

## Problems

1. Tightly coupled code responsible for instantiating objects.

## Solution

Creator and Product interfaces to which you create _concrete_ classes.

## Pros

- Loose coupling

## Definition

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
